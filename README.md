# Lazarus_HelloMoon

 
Sick of the usual **Hello World** app and looking for something a little more detailed?

Then here it is - **Hello Moon** - A variant of the Lunar Lander program that I remember from my HP 25C calculator.

Code was found here: https://www.hpcalc.org/details/7790

There are 2 folders with slightly different versions.
1. Console-Simple - barebones pascal program
2. Console-Application - lazarus adds in TApplication with extra features to help you with a console program.
